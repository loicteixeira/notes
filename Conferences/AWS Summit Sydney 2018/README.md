# AWS Summit Sydney 2018

## The Event Itself

Well run event.

Silent sessions are surprising at first. You walk in the room and can see the speaker talking but the room is completely silent with the exception of claps. There's a bit of a disconnection between what is happening and what you hear but after a couple sessions you forget about it. Funnily enough, they ask you to raise your hand if your device is not working, but the only way to hear the question is to have a working device. Despite how they phrase it, I believe it's more for them to test their setup than anything else.

You tag for everything so they track which sessions you've been too. Partners can tag you as well when you visit their booth. I believe they'll get your email and start spamming you. This became a bit ridiculous as some point with a person walking and saying "A Tim Tam for a tag".

## Common Themes

- You should be *Well-Architected* (see corresponding talk), everybody kept referring to the different pillars of the well-architected framework/manifesto.
- You should tag your resources in AWS. Many automation and third-parties integrate based on the tags of your resources.
- Everything can and should be encrypted.
- MACHINE-LEARNING!!
