# Understanding the State of, and the Future of Cloud Computing, Beyond the Hype

> If you come to the cloud for the cost, you'll stay for the agility

## What is the Cloud?

The cloud brings to you what you would need to use those (infrastructure) technologies because it brings economy of scale, but you'll need to change your apps to take advantage of it.

Jevon's Paradox accelerate innovation: Lowering the cost of experimentation drives innovation

## Why the Cloud?

It removes varier of entry (no expensive in house infrastructure)

## How the Cloud?

Not every apps will be able to be moved to the cloud and some might need to be retired. The rest will need to be refactored.

Analytics is the focus. With the apps and data/log streams being in the cloud, you can join/normalise them more easily

## What does the future holds?

- Complexity managed with tools or it will derail us, we can't use a specific tool for each system, we need a single tool to manage them all
- Cloud application migration will saturate at 70%. Some applications/infrastructures are very bespoke and it will not be possible to convert them al to the cloud.
- Focus on data
