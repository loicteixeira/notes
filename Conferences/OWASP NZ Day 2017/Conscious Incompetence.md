# Conscious Incompetence: Started from the bottom, now we're here

The 4 stages of learning:

1. Don't know, don't care
2. Don't know, do care
3. Do know, do care
4. Do know, don't care

## State 1: Unconscious incompetence

- Don't assume they know where they are
- Get a shared knowledge of their lacks and learning objectives

## Stage 2: Conscious incompetence

- It's the scariest phase. Encourage them.
- Give clear actionnables and mesurable goals.

## Stage 3: Conscious competence

- Practice makes perfect

## Stage 4: Unconscious competence

- Becomes a second nature
- Don't get complacent, still do the skill checks.
- Encourage to go through the same phase with someone else, to teach.
