# Confession of a lactose intolerant vulnerability hunter

The charge of developers:

- Awareness
- Educate
- Ownership

The "fon-diddly-do" tool:

 	1. Clone your target
     - Github, wget, etc.
	2. Gatherer
    - Resolve app services (lang, framework, db, cache, versions)
    - Generate docker file
    - Use the *breakman* gem to statically check apps
    - Copy generic config
    - Build, scan and tear down.
	3. Scanner
    - Automated using *Burp*
	4. The Importer
    - Import data from scanner into database
	5. Analyse
    1. Organise
    2. Prioritise
    3. Fix
	6. Future
    - Better gatherer
    - More framework
    - Different scan tools
    - JS reporting server
    - Scan git history
    - Vulnerability mitigation
