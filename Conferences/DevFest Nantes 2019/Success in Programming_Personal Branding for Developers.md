# Success in Programming, Personal Branding for Developers

## What is Personal Branding?

> It is an ongoing process of developing and maintaining a reputation and impression of an individual, group, or organization. – [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_branding)

It's also about:

- who you want to be
- what you know and what you don't (see through other people's eyes)
- what you do and what you have done
- your passion, your people, your tribe

You already have a personnal brand whether you nurture it or not. Ask people about you and take ownership of it.

It's not about being super visible or the top rockstar (unless you want it to) but remember everybody can be replaced and you might want to become indispensable. But don't become indispensable by being eveil and not sharing knowledge but by bringing a lot to the table.

## How

1. Set your goal. Why do you want to manage your personal branding?
   * Control
   * Better paycheck
   * Traveling
2. Work on your brand.
   * Define it
   * Define yourself
   * List good and bad parts
   * What you want to change
   * What you want to be
3. Do something you love

How to you get more visible? It doesn't have to be world wide, it can be within your team, within a community. It depends on your goals, it's not just about your resumé anymore.

* Blogging
  * It doesn't have to be technical but it probably should a little bit as a dev
  * Someone might already has an article on X but it doesn't have your perspective
  * There are many ways to have a blog: static (Jekyll on GitHub Pages, JAM Stack on Netlify, etc), Medium, Dev.to (good for visibility), Digital Ocean for a small linux server
  * If you're no go with writing, you can train or do videos or record a podcast
  * It's not about the numbers. Even if you only help one person, you still helped someone
* Give public talks
  * Everybody can do it
  * It doesn't have to be on big staages like at conferenes, it can also be at meetups or at work during lunch and learn.
* Create content
  * Something useful to others
  * Contribute to open-source. It can be frigthening but you can start small:
    * Create issues (with steps to reproduce) when you encounter a bug
    * Help with updating the documentation
    * Find a small project, not necessarilly the biggest framework out there
* Help others on Stack Overflow or other platforms
* Network at events
