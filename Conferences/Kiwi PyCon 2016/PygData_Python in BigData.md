# PygData : Python in BigData

> Big data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it...  
> â€” Dan Ariely

Big Data uses structured (SQL), unstructured (text, images) and semi-structured (JSON, XML) data sources all together.

Big Data is about asking the right question:

| Type                   | Question        |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Descriptive analytics  | What happened?  |
| Diagnostic analytics   | Why?            |
| Predictive analytics   | What's next?    |
| Prescriptive analytics | Recommendations |

Commonly done through with `MapReduce` jobs. AWS has `EMR` (Elastic Map Reduce) which runs `Hadoop` and `HDFS` (Hadoop File System).

There is an Python utility package called `MRJob`.
