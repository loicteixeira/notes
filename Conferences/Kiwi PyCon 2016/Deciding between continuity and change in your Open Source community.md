# Deciding between continuity and change in your Open Source community

When a business decides whether to change, they do a cost analysis, i.e. how much it will save vs how much it will cost. For community, it's harder because you are looking at human joy and burnout prevention which is hard to measure.

Community will usually be against an arbitrary change, unless it's brought by the project BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) which the community respects.

Working code trumps meetings. Show a working example of the change, otherwise the discussions will only be bike shedding.

Ignore poisonous people.
