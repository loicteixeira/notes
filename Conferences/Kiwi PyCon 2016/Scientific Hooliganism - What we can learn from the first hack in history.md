# Scientific Hooliganism - What we can learn from the first hack in history

First hack (as we would call it today) with radio waves.

Few dates:
- 1836: Morse code
- 1866: Transatlantic telegraph cable
- 1886: Radio waves discovered
- 1896: 1st commercial radio patent
- 1903: Maskelyne hacks Marconi

Watch the talk, it's pretty fun.
