## Serialisation formats are not toys

YAML, XML and JSON are not safe.

- YAML: Parser usually have a `safe` flag in some way to disable Python parsing (and shell access from Python).
- XML: You already know about it.
- JSON: Uses `eval`. Maybe there's a way of disabling eval but we didn't get time to look at it.

## Codelingo.io

Linter/Code Review but also praises you for good changes.

Configurable with YAML.
