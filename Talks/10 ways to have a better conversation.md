# 10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation

## 1. Don't multitask. Be present.

## 2. Don't pontificate
> Everyone you'll ever meet will know something that you don't â€“ Bill Nye

## 3. Use open-ended questions

## 4. Go with the flow.
Let thoughts come out of your mind. Don't just hold on them and stop listening.

## 5. If you don't know, say that you don't know.

## 6. Don't equate your experience with theirs.
They are never the same. All experiences are individual. It's not about yourself, conversations aren't an opportunity for self promotion.

## 7. Do not repeat yourself
Do not just rephrase your point multiple time

## 8. Stay out of the weeds
Forget the details

## 9. Listen
Listen with the intend to understand, not the itend to reply

## 10. Be brief.
> A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
