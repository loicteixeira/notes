# The Future of Programming (by Bret Victor)

> Technology changes quickly, people minds changes slowly. It can be easy to adopt new technology but hard to adopt new ways of thinking.

> Ideas required people to unlearn what they've learned and learn to think in a new way and there's often a lot amount of resistence.

Bret Victor runs the talk like it's the 70s, displaying his slides with a overhead projector, explaining the beggining of programming – coding procedures as text files in a sequential programming model — in a very satirical way, saying "it will never happen", which is exactly what happened.

He showcases innovative ways of thinking/programming of that time:
- Sketchpad 1962, give constraints to the computer which "figures this out" (e.g. not teaching how to draw a rectangle, but constraints some lines to be mutually perpendicular).
- Planner 1969, explains a program by goals (which will become logic programming).
- Regular Expressions 1967, pattern matching.

It becomes apparent that like the binnary programmers who didn't want to learn assembly or Fortran in the 60s, we were (and are still) blind to those new ideas which fell into oblivion.

He concludes that it would be a shame if 40 years later (i.e. 2010s) we were still doing the same, and suggest that we didn't learn anything from the past. But more importantly, it would be a shame if we had forgotten those ideas and the fact that we can have new ideas about programming. It would be a shame if this was what we teach new generation as they would essentially grow up with dogma, which is really hard to break out of it. Once again, he is giving a satirical look at today's world.

> The most dangerous though you are gonna have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing, because [...] you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things.

In the 60s-70s, nobody knew what programming was so they would try anything they could think of. We, as a field, have to admit we don't know what programming is so we can embrace new ideas.
